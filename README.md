# scalable-module-boilerplate

This module adds a invoice management to the Scalable system.

## Basic Usage
Just fill out the variables in the settings.json file.
Then run the application on a free port (The Scalable system should already be running):

e.g. `meteor --settings settings.json --port 4000`

The module will automatically register itself and should be visible seconds after that.
